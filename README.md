# Markov-Random-Field-Threat-Detection-
A research project collaborated with Professor Michael Baron from American University
Statistical Research Assistant for the “Algorithms for Threat Detection” Project Jan. 2019 - Dec. 2019
● Used Markov Random Field to build logistic regression models from 911 call data during 2015 Baltimore riots
● Applied pseudo-likelihood estimation to maximize essential parameters to detect change points
● Predicted possibility of large-scale violence through detection of change-points in Markov Chains
● Conducted tests such as VIF, Stepwise Variables Selection, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant analysis, KNN,
and Random Forest to cross-validate and further optimize the model
